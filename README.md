biojava-legacy
==============

This repository contains code from BioJava 1.

The goal is to port all features present in BioJava 1 to the BioJava 3 codebase, available at https://github.com/biojava/biojava. However, until that goal is achieved this repository will remain active for minor changes and bug fixes.
